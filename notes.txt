  --Variables in curly braces are populated with data and rendered as HTML.

  	{{title}}
  </h1>

  /****Router Notes
  --Router handles converting urls to actions/code objects
  --Also loads data and assigns it to a controller.

  When /tables is visited, Ember calls the App.TablesRoute object, which finds the list of tables in the restaurant and assigns it to App.TablesController

  Route kinda like controller...

/**** Controller Notes
	Delivers model data to views and templates

	Array and Object controllers manage a model property.  They act as a proxy to the model's attributes and methods, sending them along if asked.
